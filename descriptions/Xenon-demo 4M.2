Researcher wants to use an API to start a task which will be distributed across multiple Full Stacks.
Stacks that want to participate need to agree on 1) supporting GA4GH APIs and 2) how to split the samples to process.  They need to 3) have the data staged in their system and 4) support for the TOPMed workflow created in Demo 2.
Stacks onboard all or a portion of GTEx data, expose the catalog of data via DOS, use agreed upon GUIDs (e.g. minids) and description manifest format (e.g. BDBags)
Stacks expose a WES endpoint for their workflow execution system
Stacks need to support CWL or WDL workflows from TRS
Researcher triggers the running of the appropriate workflows across the stacks using the WES API and appropriate workflow version (CWL or WDL) on the subset of data available/assigned to that stack
